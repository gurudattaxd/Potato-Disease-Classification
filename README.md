# Potato-Disease-Classification
This deep learning project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to image classification of potato leaves into three classes: Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight. Based on pattern analysis in the leaves, the model detects diseases with high accuracy, enabling farmers and researchers to act early and prevent loss of crops.


â€¢ Achieved 95% accuracy in detecting Healthy, Early Blight, and Late Blight conditions.

â€¢ Deployed using FastAPI & TensorFlow Serving for real-time inference with 30% reduced latency.
