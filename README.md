# Potato-Disease-Classification
This deep learning project classifies potato leaf images to determine whether the plant is healthy or affected by Early Blight or Late Blight. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model analyzes leaf images and provides an accurate diagnosis to aid in early disease detection.
